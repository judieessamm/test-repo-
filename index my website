  <p> I am currently learning to code with <a href ="http://www.facebook.com".Going over everything from how the internet works ,to creating websites
    and version control with git . A lot to cover in only 8 weeks! Everyone should learn to code , here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>you can understand what is going on under the hood </li>
      <li>not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
      <li>its fun!</li>
    </ol>
